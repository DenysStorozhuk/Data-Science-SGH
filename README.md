# Data Science 
Data science is a field in which I aspire to develop and acquire new skills and achievements. 
I firmly believe that data science has a promising future, as it enables us to extract valuable insights from vast datasets and provide meaningful predictions for business outcomes through robust models. 
Through my involvement in a credit scoring project and my exploration of data science methodologies, I have come to recognize that a data scientist plays a vital role as a liaison between the business and the IT department. 
They possess the ability to comprehend the challenges faced by the business and translate them into a language that the IT department can understand. 
In this repository, I have made the decision to share my notes from data science lectures as well as projects related to this field. These projects will be undertaken both as part of my coursework and for personal growth. 

Python is a popular language for data science due to its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
It has a vast collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to manipulate, visualize, and analyze large datasets. 
Python is also a high-level language, which means that developers can focus more on solving problems than on low-level programming details. Additionally, 
Python has a thriving community that continually contributes to its development, making it a robust and reliable tool for data science.
